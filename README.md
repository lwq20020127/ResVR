## üî• Introduction
Proposed ResVR compared to previous ODI rescaling and viewport rendering paradigms. (a) Conventional methods focus on improving the quality of rescaled ERP images, resulting in inferior visual experiences. (b) Considering the fact that the desired content viewed on HMDs is a rendered viewport instead of an ERP image, our ResVR directly optimizes the quality of the final viewport for users through a novel discrete pixel sampling strategy and a spherical pixel shape representation technique. (c) Visual and PSNR comparisons of rendered viewports between the two pipelines in (a) and (b) on HMDs.
